DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH

This a prototype of a zero-copy capture tool using af_packet/rx_ring and
splice()/vmsplice().

Unfortunately, it keeps dropping packets :(

Possible causes:

 * unaligned buffers given to vmsplice(), kernel doesn't like that
 * "socket to pipe to file" hack is perhaps not clever...
 * bad buckets allocation (block size, frame size, etc.)

This branch is only there for archival.
